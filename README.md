# SE4051 – Trends in Digital Media 

## Individual Assignment (10%) 

### Assignment Title 

Designing an Intelligent and Human-Centered Interactive Environment

### Assignment Duration 

The submission deadline will be communicated in due course

## Assignment Overview 

Students are required to design and develop an interactive digital environment that demonstrates intelligent behavior, adaptive responses, and user-centered design. Modern digital media systems are no longer static; instead, they are designed to detect, react, and adapt to users and their surroundings. Through this assignment, the opportunity is provided to explore these concepts by creating an environment that behaves dynamically rather than remaining fixed. Creative thinking, independent exploration, and the practical application of emerging trends in digital media are encouraged throughout this task.

## Assignment Structure 

This assignment consists of three components: 

Component 1 - Concept Proposal (20%) 

Component 2 - Interactive Environment Development (40%) 

Component 3 - Self-Study Innovation (40%) 

---

## Component 1 — Concept Proposal (20%) 

Before development is initiated, a clear idea must be defined.

A one-page concept proposal is required to be submitted, including the following:

- Title of the environment  
- Scenario or application domain  
- Target user  
- Description of how the system will demonstrate intelligent behavior  
- Planned adaptive features  
- Intended user experience  

While the concept may evolve during the development process, beginning with a clearly defined idea is considered essential.

---

## Component 2 — Interactive Environment Development (40%) 

You must design and implement a functional interactive environment.

Your system must include the following:

### Intelligent Behavior

The environment must contain at least one system that reacts based on defined conditions.

Examples include:

- Objects reacting to proximity  
- NPC responses  
- Triggered events  
- Dynamic alerts  


---

### Adaptive Environment 

The virtual space must transform in response to user interaction. 

Examples include: 

Lighting changes 

Audio feedback 

Environmental transitions 

Visual state changes 

---

### Human-Centered Design 

Your environment should prioritize the user experience.

Consider:

- Intuitive interaction  
- Clear feedback  
- Usability  
- Accessibility features  

---

## Component 3 — Self-Study Innovation (40%) 


You are required to independently explore one emerging trend beyond lecture and lab coverage and integrate it into your environment.

Possible areas include:

- AI-inspired behaviors  
- Context-aware systems  
- Emotion simulation  
- Intelligent agents  
- Multisensory interaction  
- Accessibility innovation  
- Real-world data influence  

### Self-Study Evidence

Provide a short explanation (approximately 300–500 words) describing:

- What you explored  
- Why you selected it  
- How it enhances your system  
- What you learned  

Depth of understanding is more important than technical complexity.


---

## Creative Freedom 

This assignment is intentionally open-ended to encourage innovation and originality.

You are encouraged to experiment with ideas and develop a unique interactive experience.

Possible themes include (but are not limited to):

- Smart simulations  
- Training environments  
- Adaptive learning spaces  
- Interactive narratives  
- Assistive systems  
- Intelligent game worlds  

These examples are only suggestions — original ideas are strongly encouraged.


---

## Submission Requirements 

You must submit the following: 

### 1. Interactive Unity Project 

Include only the required folders:
Assets/
Packages/
ProjectSettings/


---

### 2. Concept Proposal (Component 1) 

---

### 3. Self-Study Explanation (Component 3) 

---

## Assessment Focus 

Student work will be evaluated based on:

- Clarity of the concept  
- Demonstration of intelligent interaction  
- Effectiveness of environmental adaptation  
- Evidence of independent exploration  
- Creativity and originality  
- User-centered design  
- Technical functionality  

High-end graphics are not required.  
System behavior and interaction design are considered more important than visual polish.


---

## Important Academic Expectations 

As final-year students, individuals are expected to demonstrate:

- Initiative  
- Independent thinking  
- Design maturity  
- Problem-solving ability  

Work that closely replicates publicly available tutorials will receive lower marks.

External resources may be used for learning; however, the final submission must reflect the student's own understanding and implementation.
